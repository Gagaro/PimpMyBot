# PimpMyBot
A modular Twitch bot written in Python with a web interface.


## Goal

The goal of PimpMyBot is to have a Twitch bot which can be run locally and which would be the most modular possible.
This means that everyone should be capable of using it and customizing it for its own need, but also that adding features should be as painless as possible.

## Installation

To run from the source, get Python, clone the repository and run `pimpmybot/main.py`. A 64-bit Windows executable is available on Discord (see below).

## Create a new module

See the existing module in `core_modules` and read `utils/modules/__init__.py` to see what's possible. For now, only modules located in the `core_modules` folder are loaded.

## Discord

You can join the PimpMyBot community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/0yHGB61zLB2H3VSY). Don't hesitate to ask question, propose features or just say hello.
